## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Computer Science graduate with a passion for web and app development. In my free time, I enjoy working on personal projects to expand my technical skills and explore new technologies. 

### Recent Projects

- **Bump-Into Mobile App:** A full-stack iOS app that provides a new opportunity for unexpected meetings between students in the context of a university. I used Java, JavaScript, Swift, React Native, Firebase, NPM, GitHub, and Figma to build this app.
- **Mobile Native Application Development:** Two native iOS applications - a mortgage and savings calculator built with UIKit and a weather search app that uses SwiftUI to gather and display data from an API. I used Swift and MVC design pattern to build these apps.
- **Traffic Data-set Visualizer:** As part of a team of four, I designed, created and tested software to retrieve and process traffic data from a large data-set, which was displayed using a GUI. I used Java, JDBC API, GitHub, and Trello to build this application.

Aside from technical skills, I possess strong soft skills such as decision-making, dependability, critical-thinking, persistence, and collaboration. I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn, and I'm excited to continue growing as a developer.

Thanks for checking out my profile! ðŸ˜„
